# Gybot Robotics Science seminar

Presentations and other materials dedicated to the elective science seminar focusing the robotics. All materials are in Czech language.

## Notes and other stuff

- [ ] introduction to robotics
  - robot types - manipulators, mobile robots (walking, flying, nautical, tracked and wheeled)
  - actuators
    - summarize the basic properties, where they are used, why are they used
    - pneumatic
    - hydraulic
      - consider adding hydro-electric
    - DC motors
      - direct drive - current requirements, drones
      - quasi direct drive - explain gearbox and the reduction rate
      - servomotor - difference between the hobby-end and the high end
      - SEA - find video explaining the principle 
  - sensors
    - from the low-cost to the high end
    - show the sensors, present required physics, show estimated price, differntiate between the hobby-sensors and industry sensors
    - encoders
      - absolute vs. relative, optic vs. potentionemeters (TODO are there any other?)
      - experiments
        - 3D print absolute encoder
        - show how potentiometer work
      - links t imagase and stuff: [potentiometers as encoders](https://howtomechatronics.com/how-it-works/how-servo-motors-work-how-to-control-servos-using-arduino/), [absolute encoder](https://www.linearmotiontips.com/when-is-encoder-resolution-specified-in-bits-and-what-does-that-tell-us/)
    - ultrasound sensor - low angular resolution, cannot see every obstacles
    - sonnar
    - radar
    - microswithes and FSR
    - cameras
    - depth-cameras
    - lidars
  - case studies
    - TODO select robots such as roomba and their equipement
